a car that only consumes fuel when you're really driving."
```

```
"I understand your concern. Let's calculate together: how much

and student tracking currently cost? EDUCAFRIC saves you at 
least 15 hours per week of administration."
```

```
"Absolutely! We have demonstration accounts that give you access 
to ALL premium features for free to evaluate the platform. 
Once convinced, you activate your subscription."
