#### Key points to explain:
- **School without subscription** = No communication possible
- **Parents without subscription** = Limited reception, no sending possible
- **Recommended solution**: School-family packages with preferential rates
- **Benefit**: Complete communication, real-time tracking, maximum parental engagement

#### Commercial arguments:
> "Think of it like a phone system: to make and receive calls, each party must have a line. It's the same with EDUCAFRIC: for rich school-parent communication, everyone needs their access."
